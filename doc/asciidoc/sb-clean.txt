NAME
----
sb-clean - clean an overlay

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sb-clean* ['variant'] ['dist']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'sb-clean(1)' cleans the overlay folder out, because 'sbo(1)', by default, does
not purge the overlay chroot. We call this leaving the chroot hot. Since the
default use-case is to put the unionfs overlay point on tmpfs, this isn't a big
deal, since when you reboot, your chroot will be magically clean.

Invoke this tool to manually clean the overlay out.

OPTIONS
-------
*variant*::
    This option (always first) is the variant of chroot to use. This is
    something like "clang" or "gcc". This option defaults to "default".
    It's common to set up symbolic links to provide sane behavior.

*dist*::
    This option (always second) is the suite of chroots to use, such as
        "sid" or "testing". This option defaults to "sid", but this
        behavior may change soon to default to the last changelog target,
        not counting 'UNRELEASED'.

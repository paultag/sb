NAME
----
sb-maint - login to a given sb chroot

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sb-maint* ['variant'] ['dist']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'sb-maint(1)' provides a way to access your chroot from the host system
without painfully setting everything up.

Please do keep in mind 'sb-maint(1)' does *not* use a union mount, so if you
wish to overlay the host with a union, it's advised to set the correct
envvar (detailed in 'sb(1)'\'s manpage).

'sb-maint(1)' is different then 'sb-login(1)' in that 'sb-login(1)' will log
you into the chroot as your usual user, whereas 'sb-maint(1)' will log you
into the chroot as root.

OPTIONS
-------
*variant*::
    This option (always first) is the variant of chroot to use. This is
    something like \"clang\" or \"gcc\". This option defaults to \"default\".
    It's common to set up symbolic links to provide sane behavior.

*dist*::
    This option (always second) is the suite of chroots to use, such as
        \"sid\" or \"testing\". This option defaults to \"sid\", but this
        behavior may change soon to default to the last changelog target,
        not counting 'UNRELEASED'.

EXAMPLE
-------

$ sb-maint clang sid
 [...]
(sid)root@chroot:~#

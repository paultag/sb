NAME
----
sb-layout - layout for the 'sb(1)' bindings.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sb(1)* is a wrapper around sbuild(1) that enforces a very strict and particular
workflow on you, the developer. This setup allows you to build with any of a set
of chroots that have been slightly modified to build in a non-default way.

The usage that this was designed for was to allow test-building of packages
under both gcc(1) and clang(1), but have a clean chroot for each.

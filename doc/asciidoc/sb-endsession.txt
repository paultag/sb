NAME
----
sb-endsession - end all current sessions for a given dist

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sb-endsession 'variant' 'dist'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'sb-endsession(1)' is a wrapper around schroot to end active sessions inside
a given dist\'s chroot.

This perhaps shouldn't be directly used. If you find yourself in true need
of this tool, perhaps you should look at patching 'sb(1)' to provide correct
behavior.
